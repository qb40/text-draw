Tool for making a text-mode user interface or art in DOS.

Remind yourself of the DOS days, or do some cool ASCII art. Use the mouse as the
cursor. Drawing can be done by mouse click, which places the cursor character in
the text-canvas, or simply by simply typing wich places the character (with
current color and background color) on the text-canvas and moves the cursor to
the next position. The cursor can be moved by mouse as well as the arrow keys.
