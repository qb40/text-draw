#qb-text-draw
**qb-text-draw** is a dos tool for making a text-mode user interface or art.
Remind yourself of the dos days, or do some cool ascii art. Use the mouse as
the cursor. Drawing can be done by mouse click, which places the cursor
character in the text-canvas, or simply by simply typing wich places the
character (with current color and background color) on the text-canvas and
moves the cursor to the next position. The cursor can be moved by mouse as
well as the arrow keys.
